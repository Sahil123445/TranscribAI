1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What are you doing with?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, first time I will watch a record.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So, finally we set up Aboot's voice meter banana.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I guess.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now, could it stream a quality level controls?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I thought we were doing an ebook rock.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is the interrupt.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'll cut a lot of votes by six.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I would talk about it partially over here.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I would talk about it.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I will talk.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You come here. Come back.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Aboot demonetized him.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Good old lady Aboot.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Respect your elders Aboot.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll respect you.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Look at this lady Rishi.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What will you do?

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Shut up man.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You are already here.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's a bad way.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll just make up.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is the magic of makeup.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Why did you do this?

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I am a subban.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I know you want to say true women's say help.

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Look at me.

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's only because it's not true.

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You know.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I can't express proper image.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Rishi, that's why you are flat.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Meanwhile, Roadhog will look over there.

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Looking like Pakistan.

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
See.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Roadhog is eating champion.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I have picked out something.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I think I can do it.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Some left.

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Meanwhile, Roadhog right.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Meanwhile, full team.

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Where is it?

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay.

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's a solution gone man.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I like how he's hiding.

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
He had that one filler over there.

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh my god.

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This is a nip.

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Where is the other healer?

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Is there another healer?

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Roadhog.

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He's left.

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
He's left.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm watching you now.

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Roadhog.

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He had no other healer.

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Roadhog.

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He's right.

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Roadhog.

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He's left.

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He's left.

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Rai and Billa.

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Nater.

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Mercy, Nater.

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Rai and Billa.

65
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Rai and Nater.

66
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Rai and Nater.

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I want it again.

68
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I should go to my wedding.

69
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He's right.

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He's left.

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm dead.

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm dead.

73
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Oh.

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Who from where and why?

75
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Mac.

76
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Mac.

77
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Mac and cheese.

78
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Mac and cheese.

79
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Mac and cheese.

80
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Mac and cheese.

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Have you ever had spicy Mac and cheese?

82
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Mac and cheese.

83
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That is fucking amazing.

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Mac and cheese has to be normal.

85
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
it's dead

86
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
it's dead

87
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
yeah yeah it's dead

88
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
it's high enough but i have to talk to you

89
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
i heard the high noon i'm looking at it

90
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
it's very dark

91
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
it's nothing to see it

92
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
i'm not sure if i'm high enough

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
that was an easy fight

94
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
it didn't realize it was that easy but

95
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
i know

96
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
we did a lot of work there

97
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
boy it's supposed to be a 10 minute video

98
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
it's supposed to be a 10 minute video

99
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
i don't know if i'm sorry

100
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
it's already 10 minute mark

101
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
i don't know i'm sorry

102
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
our setup included should be 10 minutes

103
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
i enjoyed

104
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
i think 10 minutes match 1 minute

105
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the matches

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
oh god

107
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000

108
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000

ryan is not that good this shield

135
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
ryan is not that good this shield

136
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000

145
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and you push man

146
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000

i was kind of pushing up forward

163
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
when you said

164
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
this push

165
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
because around the corner

166
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
was when everyone stayed on the standing

167
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
like my friend

168
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
i don't trust

169
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
i don't trust

170
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
i don't trust

171
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
i don't trust

172
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
i don't trust

173
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
i don't trust

174
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
i have it

175
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
i have it

176
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
