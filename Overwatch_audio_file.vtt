WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
What are you doing with?

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
So, first time I will watch a record.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
So, finally we set up Aboot's voice meter banana.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
I guess.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Now, could it stream a quality level controls?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I thought we were doing an ebook rock.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
This is the interrupt.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
I'll cut a lot of votes by six.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
I would talk about it partially over here.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
I would talk about it.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
I will talk.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
You come here. Come back.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Aboot demonetized him.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Good old lady Aboot.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Respect your elders Aboot.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
I'll respect you.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Look at this lady Rishi.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
What will you do?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Shut up man.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
You are already here.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
That's a bad way.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
I'll just make up.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
This is the magic of makeup.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Why did you do this?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I am a subban.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I know you want to say true women's say help.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Look at me.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
It's only because it's not true.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
You know.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I can't express proper image.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Rishi, that's why you are flat.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Meanwhile, Roadhog will look over there.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Looking like Pakistan.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
See.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Roadhog is eating champion.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
I have picked out something.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I think I can do it.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Some left.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Meanwhile, Roadhog right.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Meanwhile, full team.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Where is it?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Okay.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
It's a solution gone man.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
I like how he's hiding.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
He had that one filler over there.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Oh my god.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
This is a nip.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Where is the other healer?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Is there another healer?

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Roadhog.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
He's left.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
He's left.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I'm watching you now.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Roadhog.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
He had no other healer.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Roadhog.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
He's right.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Roadhog.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
He's left.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
He's left.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Rai and Billa.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Nater.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Mercy, Nater.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Rai and Billa.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Rai and Nater.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Rai and Nater.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
I want it again.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
I should go to my wedding.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
He's right.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
He's left.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
I'm dead.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I'm dead.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Oh.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Who from where and why?

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Mac.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Mac.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Mac and cheese.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Mac and cheese.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Mac and cheese.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Mac and cheese.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Have you ever had spicy Mac and cheese?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Mac and cheese.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
That is fucking amazing.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
Mac and cheese has to be normal.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
it's dead

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
it's dead

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
yeah yeah it's dead

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
it's high enough but i have to talk to you

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
i heard the high noon i'm looking at it

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
it's very dark

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
it's nothing to see it

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
i'm not sure if i'm high enough

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
that was an easy fight

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
it didn't realize it was that easy but

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
i know

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
we did a lot of work there

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
it's supposed to be a 10 minute video

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
i don't know i'm sorry

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
our setup included should be 10 minutes

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
i enjoyed

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
i think 10 minutes match 1 minute

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
the matches

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
It's okay.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
It's over.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
I can't change it.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
That's good.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
They're trying to kill me.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
They're trying to kill me.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
They're trying to kill me.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Why did they try to kill me?
